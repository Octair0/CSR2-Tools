EliteTRB Creator by Octair

1. Max out the cmlv's in your nsb that you want the trb to include
2. Place your nsb in this folder and run the exe. That's it.


+Currently, the ability to max out your elite cars while online is in the works, so DO NOT use elite cars that already have an upgrade.
+Per stated above, only use this trb to max out cars originally at 0 when you edit your nsb.
+Please add this folder to your excluded list in Windows Defender [Virus & Threat Protection -> Exclusions -> Add or Remove Exclusion -> +Add an Exclusion -> Folder], or at least stop your antivirus from blocking the script.
+Both packed and unpacked nsbs will work, they're automatically converted.
+If you use an unpacked nsb, the produced trb will also be left unpacked, allowing you to check and pack them together.
+If a new Elite car is added to the game, I will try to get a new database file for it made as soon as possible.
+Editing any of the files in the database will likely break your trbs made with that file. DO NOT TOUCH THE DATABASE UNLESS YOU'RE ADDING ANOTHER CAR
+This tool uses trbs directly from the game (thanks to ZXC) with slight modifications to work with this script.
+As long as the nsb has "nsb" anywhere in it's name, this toll will find it.
+"Success.png"s are screenshots of what it will look like when the script runs successfully.
+If you run into "vcruntime???.exe" issues, download https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe and install it.
